    3. Document **each parameter** with `@param`, describing the name and purpose.
    4. Include a `@returns` tag with a description of the return value.
    5. If the function throws any exceptions, include a `@throws` tag for each.
    6. Include a `@example` block showing one or two typical usages.

    **Do NOT wrap the output in backticks, triple backticks, or any Markdown formatting.**
