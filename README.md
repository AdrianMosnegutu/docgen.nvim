## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

`docgen.nvim` provides several configuration options to tailor the plugin to your needs. Below are the default configurations:

````lua
{
    ui = {
        highlight = "signature", -- What part of the function to highlight: "full", "signature", "none"
        highlight_color = "#545454", -- Default function highlight color used in the UI
    },
    runner = "ollama",         -- Default runner for executing model tasks
    model = "llama3.2",        -- Default model to use for documentation generation
    prompt_template = [[
        You are a documentation assistant.

        Generate a **TypeScript TSDoc** comment block for the function below. The output must:

        1. Start with `/**` and end with `*/` (pure TSDoc format).
        2. Include a **clear and concise function description**.
        3. Document **each parameter** with `@param`, describing the name, type, and purpose.
        4. Include a `@returns` tag with a description of the return value.
        5. If the function throws any exceptions, include a `@throws` tag for each.
        6. Include a `@example` block showing one or two typical usages.

        **Do NOT wrap the output in backticks, triple backticks, or any Markdown formatting.**
        Do **not** include the function code in your output.
        Just return the unwrapped TSDoc block as plain text.

        ```typescript
        {{code}}
        ```
    ]],
}
````

You can override any of these configurations in your Neovim setup file to customize the plugin's behavior.

‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: The `prompt_template` must include a `{{code}}` placeholder. This placeholder will be replaced by the actual function code during documentation generation. Without it, the plugin will not know where to place the code, leading to unexpected behavior.
